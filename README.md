# HTML-and-CSS-Projects

Here are a few sample websites I made using HTML and CSS:

## Projects
- [Bike Rental Site](https://github.com/Sarah-ZW/HTML-and-CSS-Projects/blob/main/Project%201/index.html)
- [National Parks Site](https://github.com/Sarah-ZW/HTML-and-CSS-Projects/blob/main/bootstrap4_project/academy_national%20parks.html)

# Bike Rental Site

This page is an example home page for a bike rental company.  It is styled using CSS and contains a navbar, image containers, and a form.

# National Parks Site

This page is an example home page for a travel company that specializes in travel to National Parks.  It is styled using Bootstrap 4. It contains many Bootstrap components, a few of which are: navbar, jumbotron, form, and cards.
