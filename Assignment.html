	<h1> Pickleball is not just for retirees anymore! </h1>
	<h3> It's spreading fast throughout the country. </h3>
	<p> Three years ago, I had never heard of pickleball; now I play twice per week.  There is a group that meets
		in a town near me where people play morning and night.  Typically there's between 10 and 40 people depending
		on the day.  A normal thing to say in pickleball is 
		<blockquote> "Stay out of the kitchen." </blockquote>

	<h6> Google pickleball near you, I bet you'll find something within 30 or 40 minutes. </h6>
